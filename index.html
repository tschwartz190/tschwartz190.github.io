<p class="intro"> I believe that I was meant to be an explorer. Were I alive 500 years ago, I would have volunteered on an expedition to discover the New World.
A century ago, I would have trekked with the great polar expeditions across the ice caps.</p>

<p class="intro"> Modern exploration takes the form of science and technology. How can we learn more about ourselves, our planet, our universe? And in what ways can we use the 
laws of physics to our advantage? Studying Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia, every day I expand my horizons, learning more about the physical laws 
of our universe and how we can use technology to enhance human capabilities. </p>

<p class="intro"> I've learned a lot during my studies and while working in both physics research and the engineering industry. I hope to continue to gain experience during my 
degree through the <a href="http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">UBC Co-op program</a> and find the field I will work in during my career.

	<p>I spent the spring semester of 2016 as part of the Miller Group at the <a href="http://www.mpsd.mpg.de/en" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD)</a>.
	Working as a support engineering intern at one of the world's foremost research institutions, I designed, built and installed optical and mechanical systems that contribute 
	to ultrafast infrared laser experiments. My main project was the design, construction, and installation of a <a href="https://www.rp-photonics.com/frequency_resolved_optical_gating.html" target="_blank">
	frequency-resolved optical gating</a> (FROG) device for near-infrared wavelength lasers.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Apart from learning mechanical, electrical, and optical design principles, working at MPSD allowed me to get a feel for how work at a research institution differs from industry work. 
	My co-workers, nearly all holding doctorates or pursuing them, were willing to share their extensive knowledge of physics and engineering with me, and I learned a lot. For example, 
	did you know that the German word for threaded screws is "Zylinderschrauben"?

	<p>
		After my first year of university I spent the summer working in the Input/Output Drawer Hardware Design department of <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/" target="_blank">Z Systems</a> 
		at IBM Poughkeepsie. During my tenure, I was responsible for the implementation of a database search tool that is still in use in the department. As the only software worker in 
		a team of hardware engineers, I learned the valuable skill of initiative, since there was no one to ask for help.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Working at the world's leading mainframe designer and completely controlling my own project was exhilarating. I set up and ran meetings with other employees, regularly briefed my 
		superiors, and taught myself 3 programming languages. At IBM, I learned the ins and outs of navigating a massive company, and making my own unique contribution.
	</p>
	
	<h2> Teaching Assistant </h2>
	<h4> <i> University of British Columbia. Fall 2016 </i></h4>
	
	<p>
		After excelling in the Principles of Software Construction course (CPEN 221), I was offered a TA position for the Fall 2016 semester. Holding office hours, proctoring exams, and 
		grading is hardly glamorous work, but I enjoy seeing a class from the teachers' side. It's very rewarding to help students understand a difficult topic, or to grade an assignment 
		where the student really knocked it out of the park. And since working in academia is a career option that I may want to explore, what better way test it out?

	<h2> Volunteering in the Jones Lab </h2>
	<h4> <i> University of British Columbia. Fall 2016 </i> </h4>
	<p>
		Since returning to UBC after my work at <a href="http://www.mpsd.mpg.de/en" target="_blank">MPSD</a>, I have been volunteering in Professor David Jones' 
		<a href="http://www.phas.ubc.ca/~djjones/" target="_blank">research lab</a> for several hours each week. Much of his work involves optics, similar to my work at MPSD. I perform engineering support tasks for his and his graduate 
		students' experiments, specifically circuitry design and construction.

	<h2> The Robot Competition </h2>
	<h4> <i> University of British Columbia. Summer 2016 </i></h4>
	<p>
		Engineering Physics, my degree program, is famous at UBC for its <a href="Text Files/ENPH253 Rules.pdf" download>robot competition</a>, where students build robots for a 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrXCJz5u2yc" target="_blank">round-robin competition</a>. My team of four built a successful robot, winning two matches before its unlucky defeat. 
		Check out our <a href="https://blogs.ubc.ca/enph253group1/" target="_blank">team website</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>I was responsible for mechanical design and construction, including conceptualizing the design and creating a comprehensive SolidWorks model. I also manufactured the robot with a laser 
	cutter, waterjet machine, mill and lathe, and various hand tools. I was also involved in electrical and software design and implementation. The robot competition was a fun way to gain 
	practical engineering experience, often learning design principles the hard way!

	<h2> UBC Sailbot </h2>
	<h4> <i>University of British Columbia. Fall 2014-Summer 2016</i> </h4>
	<p>
		I was a member of the <a href="https://ubcsailbot.org/" target="_blank">UBC Sailbot</a> team, which designed and built a robotic sailboat for the task of autonomously crossing the Atlantic Ocean. 
		Named Ada, the boat set sail from Newfoundland in August of 2016, but unfortunately failed to reach its goal of Ireland.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I worked on the mechanical design and construction team. My design work mostly concerned installation and control methods for Ada's sails. I also was heavily involved in construction, 
	including a lot of woodwork! I will never forget those endless hours spent sanding her to a smooth surface before applying the outer carbon-fibre layer.

	<h2> Mechanical Design </h2>
	<p>
	Particularly developed during my time at MPSD and the ENPH253 robot competition, mechanical design is my strongest engineering discipline. I have extensive experience in 
	computer-aided design (CAD) programs. In particular, I have worked a great deal with SolidWorks and Solid Edge, and other programs to a lesser degree. While specific controls 
	change, all CAD programs share similar characteristics.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I also enjoy learning about mechanical engineering by working with my hands. During the ENPH253 robot course, I learned the basics of machine tools including metal lathes 
	and mills, and developed skills with waterjet and laser cutters. During my time with UBC Sailbot, I helped construct our boat, including woodwork and carbon-fibre installation, 
	among other things. I also enjoy tinkering on my own, and am becoming quite handy!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	On top of practical skills, I have also taken a variety of mechanical engineering courses at UBC, including materials analysis and mechanical design classes. Applying the skills 
	I learn in the classroom to practical work helps me knit all my mechanical knowledge together.
	</p>
	
	<h2> Programming and Computer Engineering </h2>
	<p>
	Since high school, I have been a proficient programmer. My first technical job, at IBM, involved database interfacing and data processing, in a combination of 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank">SQL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovy_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Groovy</a>, and other programming languages. 
	I am also working as a teaching assistant in a programming course in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	 I believe that any modern engineer worth their salt should know their way around a computer, and be able to implement at least some simple coding. Personal programming 
	 projects are things that I sometimes work on for fun, in my spare time. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/tschwartz190" target="_blank">Github</a> account for a quick example. For 
	 another example, take a look around! I programmed this webpage from scratch, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a> and 
	 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank">CSS</a>.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 What I've learned from my experience in coding is that, no matter how many programming languages you know, there will always be another you need to learn. That's why I try 
	 to notice similarities between languages (and there are many!) to facilitate gaining a quick, working knowledge of a new language. In this way, I was able to become somewhat 
	 proficient in SQL in one day while working at IBM, and get started on my project.
	 </p>
	 
	 <h2>Electrical Skills</h2>
	 <p>
	 A good knowledge of circuitry had served me well both at university and in my work. One of my prouder moments working at MPSD was when I came up with the idea for a simple circuit 
	 that was later able to synchronize our laser firing with other equipment. When I later implemented my idea and installed it, the experiment's efficiency was more than doubled!
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 Other than working at MPSD, my current work at the Jones lab mostly involves building support circuitry. I have thus far built circuits intended to control piezo-motor motions, accouting 
	 for micro-adjustments in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_cavity" target="_blank">cavity</a> length of the lab's laser. It's fun to go to the lab and do a bit of circuit design as a study 
	 break during the semester, working different parts of my brain and keeping up my electrical skills. I also participated in circuitry for my team's robot during the ENPH253 competition, 
	 though my main contribution to the robot was mechanical design.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 So far during my university education, I have taken several circuit analysis courses, including both practical design and circuit element analysis classes. It is these courses which gave me 
	 the practical knowledge that I use every day in the Jones lab, and helped me with my successes at MPSD.
	 </p>
	 
	 <h2>Physics Research</h2>
	 <p>
	 While no undergraduate can really claim to have "experience" in physics research, I have worked extensively in research settings, both at UBC and for employment. Spending 4 months at the Max 
	 Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter was far too short a time, but I learned a great deal about not just optics and phsyics, but also standard lab and research procedures. 
	 It was that experience which convinced me to volunteer in a lab again once back at UBC. I hope to again work in a research environment, in particular studying astronomy or fluid mechanics.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 On top of my practical experience, I have also taken many physics classes, including electromagnetism, newtonian mechanics, quantum mechanics, and astronomy. Physics is a major part of my 
	 degree, as the name Engineering Physics suggests, and it is one part that I particularly look forward to.

	<p> Born in Toronto, I was raised mostly in the small town of New Paltz, NY, where I graduated from high school as the second in my class. 
	I moved out to Vancouver, BC to earn my undergraduate degree in the fall of 2014. I am currently in my third year of 
	the <a href="http://www.engphys.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">Engineering Physics</a> program at the <a href="http://www.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">University of British Columbia</a>.</p>
	
	<p>
	The first picture on this page was taken in the middle of a hike up the Lions, a double peak near Vancouver. While certainly 
	not prepared for that much snow (the hike was in June), I had a great time struggling up 60 degree snow banks in my shorts and a T-shirt. 
	I've also been skydiving, cliff jumping, ziplining across a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_forest" target="_blank">cloud forest</a>,
	camel riding in the Sahara Desert, bargaining in a Chinese market (in Mandarin), and many others.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I am also a former long-distance runner, competing for the UBC Thunderbirds in Cross-Country and Track and Field for two years. It is my ambition to, one day, 
	complete an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_Triathlon" target="_blank">Ironman triathlon</a>, consisting of a 2.4 mile swim, a 112 mile bike, and a 26.22 mile run 
	(a marathon). And yes, you do it straight through.

	I love to travel. So far, I have visited 21 countries on 4 continents, including living in Xi'an, China for a year. While working at MPSD in Hamburg, Germany for 4 months, 
	I managed to travel to a different city nearly every weekend. From big-ticket sites like Berlin, Prague, and Copenhagen to more unknown places like 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylt" target="_blank">Sylt</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vy%C5%A1ehrad">Vysehrad</a>, and the 
	<a href="http://daspanzermuseum.de/index.php?id=home" target="_blank">Deutches Panzermuseum</a> (German tank museum), I took advantage of every minute in Europe. While 
	each place I go is unique, my favourite tourist experience was probably my visit to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volubilis" target="_blank">Volubilis</a>, 
	a ruined Roman city located in modern-day Morocco. Since I am studying Classical and Roman History as a minor, it was amazing to see everything I had learned in the 
	classroom brought to life.
