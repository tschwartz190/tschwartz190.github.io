<h1> Welcome </h1>
<p> I believe that I was meant to be an explorer. Were I alive 500 years ago, I would have volunteered on an expedition to discover the New World.
A century ago, I would have trekked with the great polar expeditions across the ice caps.</p>

<p> Modern exploration takes the form of science and technology. How can we learn more about ourselves, our planet, our universe? And in what ways can we use the 
laws of physics to our advantage? Studying Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia, every day I expand my horizons, learning more about the physical laws 
of our universe and how we can use technology to enhance human capabilities. </p>
